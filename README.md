# Calculator Webapp

Basic calculator for the Odin Project.

## Description

Use this calculator by clicking on the buttons to perform different operations.

## What I learned

I used a dict to map symbols to functions, which I didn't know was possible in JS. I also had to think about the different variables moving around (there were a lot).

## What I could improve

There are a couple bugs with this still. Whenever you enter a number that is too large to fit the display box, it clips it in a weird way where the number is no longer visible. I also could have spent more time commenting on functions to make it easier to understand, but to be honest, I just wanted to get through this one quickly since it wasn't *too* much difficulty.
